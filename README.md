#  Stable Diffusion webui Infinite Image Browsing

<p style="text-align:center;margin:0 32px;">Not just an image browser, it is also a powerful image manager. Accurate image search combined with multi-select operations greatly improves efficiency. It also supports running in independent mode without SD-Webui.</p>

## Preview

## Image Search

During the first use, you need to click and wait for the index generation. For my case with 20,000 images, it took about 15 seconds (with an AMD 5600X CPU and PCIe SSD). For subsequent uses, it will check whether there are changes in the folder, and if so, it needs to regenerate the index. Usually, this process is very fast.

Image search supports translation, and you need to place a "tags-translate.csv" file in the plugin folder. You can find this file in the issue . Feel free to share files for other languages to facilitate everyone's use.

## Full Screen Preview

In full-screen preview mode, you can also view image information and perform operations on the context menu. It supports dragging, resizing and expanding/collapsing .

If you, like me, don't need to view the generation information, you can choose to simply minimize this panel, and all contextual operations will still be available.
